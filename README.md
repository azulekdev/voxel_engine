# 🟩This is Voxel Engine🟫
Hi! im @azulekdev. i made this out of boredom and out of free will. Whatever i made here made me go depressive so yea cool.
# This is basically an engine that was made to be used for any blocky game u want, i inspired the engine off Minecraft/Hytale so u could make any game close to that, ofc its bad but its made open-source so u can modify it. Its going to be better in the future
